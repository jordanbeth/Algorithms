Problem Poker Winner
- Given two hands of cards, determine which player is winning in a game of poker.

- Assume that the game is played using high rules (meaning that an Ace can rank either high or low, but cannot rank both high and low in the same hand).

 Example

player1 = ["QD", "JD", "TD", "AD", "KD"]
player2 = ["JS", "TC", "QH", "2H", "4C"]
pokerWinner(player1, player2) = 1
=end

def poker_winner(player1, player2)

end
